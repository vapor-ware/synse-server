# IPMI Emulated Composefile
#   this composefile spins up two containers: one being an IPMI emulator, and
#   the other being a synse server instance that is configured for that
#   IPMI emulator. while there is only one IPMI emulator instance, we use
#   links to essentially create proxies to that emulator, so within synse server
#   it looks like we have many IPMI emulators (BMCs).
