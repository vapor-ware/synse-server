PREREQUISITES

	Libmpsse is currently supported on the Linux and OSX platforms.

	Libmpsse requires swig as well as the libftdi and python development packages. 
	These can typically be installed by your Linux distro's package manager, such as:

		# apt-get install swig libftdi-dev python-dev

	For OSX, you will likely need to at least install libftdi from source. Note that
	libftdi also requires the libusb-0.1 (not libusb-1.0) library.

INSTALLATION

	With the required prerequisites installed, libmpsse can be built and installed:

		$ ./configure
		$ make
		# make install

	Required paths, such as include and library directories, will typically be detected 
	automatically by the configure script. To specify alternative directory paths, you 
	may set the following environment variables:

		SWIG   - Path to the swig binary
		PYDEV  - Path to the python include directory where the python header files are located
		PYLIB  - Path to the python library directory where python modules should be installed

	Example:

		$ PYDEV=/usr/local/include/python2.6/ ./configure
		$ make
		# make install

	To build without the Python wrapper libraries, specify the --disable-python argument
	when running the configure script:

		$ ./configure --disable-python

BUILDING EXAMPLE CODE

	After libmpsse has been installed, you can build the example C programs by running:

		$ make examples

UNINSTALLATION
	
	Libmpsse can be uninstalled from your system by running:

		# make uninstall
