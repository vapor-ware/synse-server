"""Synse Server commands package.

This package contains the command definitions for all Synse Server
endpoints.

Command functions are imported here for easier importing elsewhere,
e.g. instead of having to do 'from synse.commands.scan import scan'
you can simply 'from synse.commands import scan'.
