""" Vapor Configuration Manager

This module contains the configuration manager, a common component among
Vapor projects. The configuration manager expects the config files which
it operates on to be json files.

    The contents of a read-in JSON file become attributes of the object. No
    validation is done on the contents of the JSON (e.g. for value type/value).
    The config options are then accessible via dot notation on the config
    object.

    Configuration files can also be written out, using the internal object dict
    to generate the JSON file.

    Note that when writing out the config JSON, the ConfigManager will ignore
    any attribute which starts with "_" (reserved for object private members).
    Accordingly, values in the config JSON should never start with "_".
