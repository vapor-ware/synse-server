""" Redfish Emulator

Starts up the flask app and serves resources. Reads in parameters from
emulator_config.json and passes it to the server with those values
unless they are overridden on start up.

This was based off of DMTF's Redfish-Profile-Simulator (see LICENSE.txt
in the redfish emulator directory, and attribution, below):
