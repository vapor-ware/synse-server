    FIXME - the 'IPMIAuthType' class was named early on during model development here.
    While this context is not an 'auth type', the base class does contain all of the fields
    available for the context to store, so it is convenient to use. in the future, it
    may make sense to re-name / re-organize things a bit so that the naming of objects in
    the class hierarchy make a bit more sense.

    This is ultimately just a thin wrapper around the base class to make its purpose
    better-known.
