""" Synse API Device Bus Scan Tests on Emulator

NOTE: these tests might (and perhaps should) belong in the "devicebus" test
suite, but because that test suite uses intentionally invalid board/device
values for the tests, scan all will not work correctly and will give back
hokey data. These tests are to ensure correct scan all behavior.
