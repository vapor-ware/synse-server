class DevicebusInterface(object):
    """ Base interface for all Devicebus objects supported by Synse.

    Primarily, this defines some common methods that can be used or overridden
    by its subclasses. Of note, the `_instance_name` member should be used by
    terminal subclasses to specify the name of the device that class represents.
    This is particularly useful for identifying individual device types, as is
    done for I2C and RS485 devices.

    A `handle` method is also defined and should NOT be overridden. It provides
    the device logic to process an incoming Command and dispatch it to the Device's
    appropriate handler method, if it exists.

    Finally, a `register` method is defined but not implemented. Device
    registration is dependent on the type of devicebus instance being registered,
    therefore it is left to the specific devicebus instance to define its own
    register method.
