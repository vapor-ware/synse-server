    Vapor IO

  Synse provides a unified API for the monitoring and control of
  data center and IT equipment, including reading sensors and
  server power control.

  By default only the Synse service will run, but additional
  subcommands can be specified to modify the behavior - for
  example, starting up an emulator.

  USAGE:
    docker run vaporio/synse-server [flag | subcommand]

  Flags:
    --help | -h     Show this message.
    --version | -v  Show the version of Synse.

  Subcommands:
    enable-emulator
            Start a built-in emulator to provide mock data to Synse.
            This can be useful for testing and learning about Synse.
            A default emulator configuration is provided, but different
            configurations can be used by either volume mounting in
            custom configurations (to /synse/synse/emulator/config)
            or by building a custom image with those configs already
            changed.
