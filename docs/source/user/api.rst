API Reference
=============
The Synse Server `API Documentation <https://vapor-ware.github.io/synse-server/>`_ is hosted
on GitHub pages. The source for it lives in the ``docs/api`` directory and can be build locally
as well, if desired.

.. code-block:: bash

    # build the docs
    make docs


This will create ``docs/index.html``, which can also be opened with

.. code-block:: bash

    # view the docs
    make api-docs
