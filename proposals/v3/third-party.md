# Third Party Access
## Summary
As the Synse platform matures, customers may want to start interfacing with it to
get data from their equipment, or from the environment their equipment is in. In
order to do this, API access and usage by third parties must be designed and supported.

This is not a requirement for Synse v3, but it is worth spending some time on, as it
may inform other aspects of Synse design.

## High Level Work Items
- Determine requirements for third party access

## Proposal
There is currently no proposal for this item. Prior to writing a proposal for this,
the use cases and requirements must be determined.
