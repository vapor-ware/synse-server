# Synse v3 Proposals
This directory contains proposals and specifications for Synse v3. 

## Overview
Synse v3 is the next iteration of the Synse platform that will bring simplifications
and generalizations to the platform, doing away with design patterns from older versions
that are no longer needed. These changes should make the HTTP API more intuitive, make
plugin development simpler, expand the platform's capabilities, and allow for better
visibility and monitoring of the services themselves.

The documents in this directory focus on particular aspects of Synse v3 -- all of
them together are considered the proposal/spec for Synse v3.

### Primary Goals
- Replace the *rack/board/device* routing hierarchy with a tag-based routing system
- Maintain having deterministic device IDs with the IDs being globally unique (instead of only
  being unique to the rack/board)
- Expand API capabilities
- Provide better support for container management/monitoring
- Improve performance, where possible
- Maintain high test coverage
