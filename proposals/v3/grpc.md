# GRPC API
## Summary
The Synse GRPC API is used to communicate to Synse Plugins. Synse Server uses this
API for all plugin communication, including reading and writing,

Synse v3 brings a number of changes both to how devices are modeled and to information
that Synse exposes to the user via the HTTP API. In order to support all of the changes,
the GRPC API must be updated so that the appropriate data may flow between Synse Server
and the Synse plugins.

## High Level Work Items
- Update the GRPC API according to this document's spec
- Add python client wrapper to GRPC python package

## Proposal
This document outlines the Synse v3 GRPC API. It lists the RPC routes that it will support
and the messages for each RPC route.
